  abstract = "We investigate the historical roots of the field of combinatorics on words. They comprise applications and interpretations in algebra, geometry and combinatorial enumeration. These considerations gave rise to early results such as those of Axel Thue at the beginning of the 20th century. Other early results were obtained as a by-product of investigations on various combinatorial objects. For example, paths in graphs are encoded by words in a natural way, and conversely, the Cayley graph of a group or a semigroup encodes words by paths. We give in this text an account of this two-sided interaction."

  abstract = "A k-color, n-bead necklace is an equivalence class of k-ary n-tuples under rotation. In this paper, we analyze an algorithm due to Fredricksen, Kessler, and Maiorana (FKM) to show that necklaces can be generated in constant amortized time. We also present a new approach to generating necklaces which we conjecture can also be implemented in constant amortized time. The FKM algorithm generates a list of n-tuples which includes, among other things, the lexicographically smallest element of each k-color, n-bead necklace. Previously it had been shown only that the list contains at most O(n · N(k, n)) elements, where N(k, n) is the number of k-color, n-bead necklaces, and that successive elements can be generated in worst case time O(n), giving a bound of O(n2 · N(k, n)) on the time for the algorithm. We show that the number of elements generated by the FKM algorithm approaches (k(k − 1)) · N(k, n) and the total time is only O(N(k, n)). A by-product of our analysis is a precise characterization of the list generated by FKM, which makes a recursive description possible."
